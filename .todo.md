# Development
## remove-metrics-and-mongodb
- add env in GitHub actions
- remove password and add comments in docker compose file
## feature/PIC-42 Implement metric model and API
- model
- makemigration
- viewset
- serializer
- unit test
## feature/PIC-41 Parse metrics result file to metric
- read file from object storage
- parse file (need a metric spec with perturber)
- save metrics to database
## feature/PIC-43 Post-processing
- compute confidence interval
## Design decision - Polling or Event-driven
- PiCrystal Enterprise app to K8s CR
- AI Hub app to PiCrystal Enterprise app
- Improve K8s CRD based on design decision
# E2E test
- local K8s env
- Test case 
  - hiring
  - PeopleNet
  - Nemo

# GTM support
## Uniqueness of PiCrystal (Anna)
- Reliability: Simple and reliable statistics theory framework to carry out all kinds of performance-based assessments (Performance, Fairness, Robustness, XAI) -> Antoine, Stefan, Mahesh, Denis
- Extensibility: Pluggable embedders and perturbers to handle various AI use cases -> Antoine, Max, Mahesh, Denis
- Efficiency: Optimized execution achieved by DAG (Directed Acyclical Graph) orchestration -> Denis
- Corretness: Better edge case handling, e.g. interval estimation instead of point estimation, additive property of assessment result, etc. -> Antoine, Stefan, Mahesh, Denis
- Production-ready: Enterprise ready platform for executing E2E AI governance process -> Enrico, Mikhail, Mike, Kate
- Scalablity: (Upcoming) Star schema storage to standardize the generation and consumption of metrics  -> Antoine, Artur, Denis, Mike, Kate
- Easiness: (Upcoming) Out-of-box embedders and perturbers package for common AI use cases -> ???

## UPMC demo
- real case?
- health care case?
